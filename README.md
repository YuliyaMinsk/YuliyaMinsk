## :heart: Welcome

Hi there! I'm a Frontend Developer with 10+ years of experience, passionate about building clean, thoughtful, and scalable web applications.
I work with JavaScript, TypeScript, and modern frameworks like React and Vue (Nuxt 3) — turning complex ideas into intuitive user interfaces.

Lately, I’ve been diving into the world of Machine Learning, exploring Natural Language Processing (NLP) with spaCy and building APIs with FastAPI — bridging the gap between frontend and intelligent backend systems.
